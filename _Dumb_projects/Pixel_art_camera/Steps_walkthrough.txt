import os dependency for path finding
import cv2 dependency for camera access


1) just for the ease out of it we want to get the directory of the place where we are working
2) we then create a new directory called "output_videos" and then check if it already is created or not
3)  Get the files from the directory and check if it ends with mp4
4) create an indexing number for the files that we see in the mp4 folder
5) check how many files there are in the listdir and add one 
6) when outputing we need to have the writing path where we want to save the video, thus
it shall be t the output_dir, "output_video_{index}.mp4"
7) get the cv2 camera video capture
8) give values for the frame height and frame_width
9) give framerate ( frame_rate = 5)
10) calculate capture capture_interval
11)output path the video
12)release and destroyAllWindows
