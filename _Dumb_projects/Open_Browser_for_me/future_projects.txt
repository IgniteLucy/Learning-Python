things i wanna try and do

1) Open discord with python - OK
2) Navigate to the login page - wait to load - join a vc channel with an account
3) Check discord for updates ( on linux / ubuntu since updating is alil annoying)
4) Make an option menu for it [1) update discord, 2) Join vc 1 , vc 2 , vc 3 ....]
5) Check my friends discord channel to download memes/videos/for myself to spare time
