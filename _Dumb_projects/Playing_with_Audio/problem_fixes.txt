[INSTALLATION ISSUES WITH simpleaudio]
1) tried to "pip install simpleaudio" but got a legacy error
2) Since im running un Ubuntu linux i needed to do the following: 'sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev'
these file are related to the ALSA Advanced linux Sound Architecture library which simpleaudio uses.
3) Retried pip install simpleaudio and it worked for me. (( if this doesnt work for you try to install pygame))
